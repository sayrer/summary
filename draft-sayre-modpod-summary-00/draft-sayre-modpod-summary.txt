1.  Introduction

   Automated summaries of IETF contributions are often useful.

   Some examples include mailing list digests, summaries of posting
   volume, and data concerning version control traffic.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Policy

   IETF participants often devise new ways of presenting IETF
   contribution data.

   If an automated summary becomes critical to an IETF effort, it should
   be transfered to the IETF Tools team.  When there is rough consensus
   and running code showing that a summary is regularly useful, it
   should be transfered away from an individual.

   If there is no consensus that a summary is useful, it should not be
   regularly sent.

4.  Security Considerations

   IETF procedures cannot depend on the resources of an individual.
   When a summary becomes important enough for participants to object to
   its absence, it must be transitioned to IETF infrastructure.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
